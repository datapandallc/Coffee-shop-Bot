Hey everyone! It's your brudda Tunji aka Data Panda. Today I'm pushing a coffee shot chat box I built some time ago with Python.
I had to make minor improvements to the python code due to me knowing better this time around.

a list of the improvements:
Fixed minor typos and formatting issues.

Improved the check for crackhead status.

Cleaned up variable usage and string formatting.

With these improvements the bot should run perfectly.

So play around with it. Enjoy! :)
